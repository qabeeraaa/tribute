                <li>Kristen Jaymes Stewart (born April 9, 1990) is an American actress and filmmaker. The world's highest-paid actress in 2012, she has received various accolades, including a British Academy Film Award and a César Award, in addition to nominations for an Academy Award and a Golden Globe Award.</li>
                <li>Born and raised in Los Angeles to parents who both worked in the entertainment industry, Stewart first gained notice at age 12 for her role as the daughter of Jodie Foster's character in David Fincher's thriller Panic Room (2002), which earned her a Young Artist Award nomination. She subsequently starred in Speak (2004), Catch That Kid (2004), Zathura: A Space Adventure (2005), and Into the Wild (2007). She went on to achieve global stardom for her role as Bella Swan in The Twilight Saga film series (2008–2012), which ranks among the highest-grossing film franchises; for the role, she was awarded the BAFTA Rising Star Award in 2010.</li>
                <li>After starring in the fantasy film Snow White and the Huntsman (2012), Stewart eschewed roles in big-budget films in favor of independent productions in the years following. She took on roles in the dramas Camp X-Ray (2014) and Still Alice (2014), and the science fiction romance Equals (2016). In 2015, she garnered critical acclaim for her performance in Olivier Assayas' drama film Clouds of Sils Maria, which won her the César Award for Best Supporting Actress. Stewart reunited with Assayas the following year in the supernatural thriller Personal Shopper (2016) and made her directorial debut with the short film Come Swim (2017). She returned to mainstream Hollywood with leading roles in the action film Charlie's Angels (2019) and the romantic comedy film Happiest Season (2020). Stewart's portrayal of Diana, Princess of Wales in Pablo Larraín's biographical drama Spencer (2021) earned her widespread critical acclaim and a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actress.</li>
                <li>Stewart resides in Los Angeles.[117] In 2017, she stated that she is bisexual, saying, "You're not confused if you're bisexual. It's not confusing at all. For me, it's quite the opposite."[118] In 2019, Stewart discussed the perceived impact of her sexuality on the success of her career, saying she had been warned not to be public with her girlfriend so that someone could cast her in mainstream roles. She said: "I don't want to work with people like that."[119] Stewart identifies as a feminist.[120] She suffers from equinophobia, the fear of horses.</li>
                <li>Stewart dated her Speak co-star Michael Angarano from 2005 to early 2009.[122][123] She was in a four-year relationship with her Twilight co-star Robert Pattinson.[124] While dating Pattinson, Stewart was photographed in July 2012 with her Snow White and the Huntsman director, Rupert Sanders, revealing an affair; the day the photos were released, both Stewart and Sanders, who was married at the time, issued public apologies.[125] From mid 2013 to fall 2016, Stewart was in a relationship with visual effects producer Alicia Cargile.[126] From late 2016 to late 2018, she was in a relationship with New Zealand model Stella Maxwell.[127] Stewart has been in a relationship with screenwriter Dylan Meyer since 2019, and stated in November 2021 that she and Meyer were engaged to be married.</li>
                <li>In 2012, Stewart signed and donated the dress she wore to the premiere of The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn Part 2 to a CharityBuzz auction benefiting the Robin Hood Foundation's Sandy Relief Fund, which provides long-term support to those affected by Hurricane Sandy.[128] In 2016, she participated in building a school in Nicaragua through the nonprofit buildOn, with the goal being to give children the opportunity to become educated in a safe space and to break the cycle of poverty and illiteracy.[129] The following year, she raised $500,000 for Hurricane Sandy relief by meeting with an unnamed "Middle Eastern prince" for 15 minutes.</li>
                <li>Stewart ranked number 7 on AskMen's list of "Top 99 Women" for 2013.[131] Glamour UK named her the best-dressed woman in 2012, 2013, and 2016.[132][133][134] In 2020, Stewart received the Actress of the Decade Award by the Hollywood Critics Association.</li>
